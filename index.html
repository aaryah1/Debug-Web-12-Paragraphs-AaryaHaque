    <h1>Types of Chocolate</h1>
    <!--On line 10 the closing paragraph tag "</>" was incorrect because there was no "p" between the slash and closing angle brakcte but I fixed the code by adding a "p" to the tag for which it changed to "</p>." -->
    <p>This page will explain differences between milk, dark, and Ruby chocolate.</p>
    <h2>Milk</h2>
    <p>Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with either liquid milk, powdered milk, or condensed milk. </p>
    <h2>Dark</h2>
    <p>Unlike milk chocolate, dark chocolate contains no milk in it, instead using more cocoa, giving it a darker color and making it more bitter.</p>
    <h2>Ruby</h2>
    <!--On line 17 the closing paragraph tag "</p" was the mistake and had no closing angle bracket and I fixed it by adding a closing angle bracket "</p>". As well as the extra period after the closing paragraph tag.-->
    <p>Ruby chocolate is made from a different cocoa bean altogether. It is made from the ruby cocoa bean, which has a red color and different flavor.</p>
